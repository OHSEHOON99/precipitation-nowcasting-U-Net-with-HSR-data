# Precipitation Nowcasting Models with Weighted Average Ensemble Methods

This code was used in the paper **"Improving Deep Learning-Based Precipitation Nowcasting Models: Application of Weighted Average Ensemble Methods"**, which focuses on improving the performance of precipitation nowcasting models through a weighted average ensemble method.

The purpose of this code is to train various deep learning models for precipitation nowcasting (e.g., U-Net, SE U-Net, Attention U-Net) and to enhance prediction performance by applying a weighted average ensemble of the model outputs.
